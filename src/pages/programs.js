          <h3>Fine Art</h3>
          <p>
            Exposure to career opportunities and educational options is an
            integral part of the program. By the end of the fourth semester, the
            disciplined and self-motivated student will draw from examples of
            all coursework for transfer to a college, university or art school.
            The successful student will also develop the skills in presentation
            needed to pursue a career in the visual arts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drawings, paintings, sculptures, ceramics and photography will
            showcase a deeper understanding of the student's own ideas. The
            Individual Studio/Professional Practices course gives students the
            opportunity to gain a greater knowledge of the art world through
            visits to museums, galleries and art centers in New York City,
            Philadelphia and the Lehigh Valley. In addition, students will speak
            with curators, gallery directors, art museum personnel and a
            visiting professional artist who will help guide and critique their
            work.

          <h3>Communication Design</h3>
          <p>
            If youâ€™re creative with an eye for design and possess strong
            problem-solving and brainstorming skills, a career in graphic design
            could be an option for you. Graphic designers prepare artwork for
            many purposes, from video game design to web animation or print
            media. The designer's process is a fascinating one. It involves
            analyzing, conceptualizing and developing ideas that are "outside
            the box" to address client needs and market to a target audience in
            a visually compelling way.
          </p>
          <p>
