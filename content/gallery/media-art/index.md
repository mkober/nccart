description: In the Media Art course students use a combination of elements, approaches and techniques from fine art and applied art with cutting-edge digital technology; theory, methodology and professional practices covered through lectures, in-class hands-on practice and outside assignments; students approach projects conceptually, synthesizing original integrative solutions, which hopefully expand existing conventions; concepts include collaboration, iteration, metaphor, art as commodity, making vs. finding, perfection vs. perfectionism, and creativity and transcendence.
