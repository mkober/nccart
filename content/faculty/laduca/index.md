Izzy LaDuca was born in Sicily, Italy in 1955. His family came to America when he was an infant and he grew up in Easton, PA. He studied at Tyler School of Art (BFA in painting) from 1973 to 1977. In 1975 took advantage of Tylerâ€™s Rome study abroad and found not only a reconnection to his cultural heritage but an increased appreciation for the great works of past European masters. He also had the opportunity to visit Sicily and see firsthand where he was born.

After Tyler, he remained connected to Philadelphia, painting, entering exhibitions, and maintaining friendships with local artists. He applied to grad school in 1984 and was accepted to Syracuse University the following year and received an MFA in Paining in 1988. He has exhibited his paintings at Connexions in Easton, and for a time was a co-op member of the Third Street Gallery in Philadelphia. In 1995 he began teaching Art History, Drawing and Painting at Northampton Community College.

In 1997 he became a reviewer for the Lehigh Valley arts paper The Irregular. The following year, along with other artists and gallery owners, he helped found the Arts Community of Easton (ACE), became a board member and has been an active participant since, working on area murals and arts events. In 2002 he received a Fellowship from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts.
