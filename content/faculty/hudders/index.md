WIlliam Hudders is a painter who paints in a directly representational style. He earned his MFA at the University of Pennsylvania where he studied with renowned artist Neil Welliver and received his BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design.

He has shown his work in New York frequently, having two solo shows at the Tatistcheff gallery which were reviewed by Ken Johnson in the New York Times and Mario Naves in the New York Observer. He has also collaborated frequently with other artists, working briefly for a time for New York artist Jeff Koons and creating a series of collaborative paintings with Lehigh University Professor of Art Berrisford Boothe. In 2008 Hudders was awarded a Pollack Krasner Foundation grant which enabled him to concentrate more intently on the creation of his work and develop a new and deeper style of landscape and still life painting.

His work has been seen in the films “Its Kind of a Funny Story” and “Bewitched” starring Will Ferrel and Nicole Kidman. His work is included in the collections of Citibank, NY, The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, The Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown Pa. as well as in the private collections of Tommy Hillfiger and Mario Andretti.
