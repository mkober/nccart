Joseph M. Chapuk is an artist/curator/facilitator/journeyman. He has exhibited his paintings, mixed media work, and installations in New York, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia, as well as the Lehigh Valley. His work is concerned with the interaction of the self in the socio-political milieu of the 21st century. Charles Biasiny-Rivera, director of En Foco in New York, has described Chapuk’s work as “Angry and raw – successfully in your face a work of witness.” Chapuk has an MFA from California State University, Los Angeles; a BFA from Otis Art Institute; and a BA in English from Colby College.

In 2006, he developed the concept for “Some Serious Business – Art of the Valley,” which converted 25,000 sq. ft. of Bethlehem steel property into a one-time only venue for installations by art faculty from colleges and universities in the Lehigh Valley. In 2007 he was the curator for “ACE at the Allentown Museum.” He was the director/curator/facilitator for ARTspace@NCC, an ad hoc gallery at Northampton Community College’s Fowler Family Southside Center from 2006 – 2007. He currently teaches Painting, Drawing, Art History, and Art and Visual Thinking at NCC.
