James Smull is a Philadelphia area fine artist born in Easton PA, whose current work focuses on a combination of painting, photography and digital media. His paintings deal with the duality of two seemingly irreconcilable systems, the grid, whose structure expresses the ordering drive of humanity and the organic gesture of serendipity, which highlights our undying connection to nature. His painting use both abstract and representational modes to connect the viewer to the idea of duality whether it is physical, visual or conceptual.

James received a MFA From Cornell University in 2002 and a BFA from Tyler School of Art in 1998. His work has been shown at the Sande Webster Gallery in Philadelphia. He has also been shown in galleries in Texas, Tennessee, New York, and throughout Pennsylvania. His work is held in both private and corporate collections in Illinois, Michigan Pennsylvania, and New York. In addition to his fine art work James is also a practicing commercial photographer, working primarily in advertising and real estate photography in Philadelphia and the Leigh Valley. James teaches Black and White Photography, Art History Survey and has also tough Computer Graphics at NCC.
