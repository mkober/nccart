Layne is a graduate of Kutztown University’s Communication Design program. With 20 years experience in all aspects of design, from logos and branding to packaging, web and product development, he brings real world knowledge to the classroom. Layne has been a designer for a Philadelphia firm, an Art Director for an International Craft Company, as well as a full service agency in Scranton, Pa.

Since starting his own studio in 2007, he has built an impressive client list. “Owning my own design firm has been an incredibly rewarding experience. Having worked with local clients including Crayola, the Mint Gastropub, Stefano’s Modern Italian Restaurant, Gravitation Brewing Company, Colony Meadery and Road Design Co., as well as national and international companies, has given me the opportunity to expand my design knowledge from a cultural and psychological perspective and allowed me to build strong client relationships. Many, I now call friends. You can’t hide the passion behind good design.” Along with teaching, his passions include music concerts, playing guitar and writing music, car collecting, furniture building, wood working and interior design.
