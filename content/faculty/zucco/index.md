Douglas attended Kutztown University where he received his BFA in 1978. Douglas earned an MFA from the University of Georgia, concentrating his studies in papermaking and sculpture. He has done extensive work in researching hand made paper and its use as an art form.

In 1980 Doug and his wife, Helene, opened White Crow Paper in the Northern Liberties of Philadelphia. White Crow Paper offers hand made paper for artists use, and provides a place for Doug and Helene to continue their creative work. Fleetwood, in Berks County, is the current home of White Crow Paper.

Douglas has had a life long commitment to the creative process, and the ongoing development of combining hand made paper techniques with current technology. Douglas has an extensive exhibition record and ongoing collaboration with other artists. Some of his works are included in the Philadelphia Public Library: Rare Book Section, Chase Manhattan Bank Collection, and the Pew Charitable Trust in Philadelphia. Douglas’s artist collaborations include “Live on Paper”, Clytie Alexander’s “Seeing Red” in the Getty Museum collection in Los Angeles, and John Yau and Max Gimblet’s “Leaves From a Chinese Album”.
