Lydia Chiappini has worked as an artist in a variety of media including oils, fibers, acrylic, watercolor, bronze, and clay since the early 1970’s. She received a BA Magna Cum Laude in Fine Art and Biology, an MA in Fine Arts Studio, metalwork and jewelry design, and a Post BA Art Certification for Art Education Grades K-12 from Montclair State University in Upper Montclair, NJ. Besides joining the adjunct art faculty teaching staff at Northampton Community College in 2012, Chiappini has also taught art history and art studio at Warren County Community College in NJ, Raritan Valley Community College in NJ, and Southern New Hampshire University, online division. Currently Chiappini is teaching Art History Survey at NCC.

In her art work Chiappini wishes to create a connection between nature and the visual forms of her images. The theme behind the work is the spirituality imbued in the living forms of nature and how these living forces power her creativity. She also has an intense interest in art history and it strongly influences her artwork. Chiappini is currently working on a body of works called “Fiber Forms: Llamassos” of fibers, oils, and fiber-inspired processes. The work includes landscapes, figures and abstractions in which llama fiber is used for sculptural collage and in felted, embroidered, handspun and hand woven images in combination with oil paints. Some images are inspired by fiber processes–canvases fragmented like quilt forms, woven dual image canvases, and felted sculptural forms. Chiappini is also working in the area of historic costume design and performance art.

Chiappini has exhibited her work at the Morris Museum in Morristown, NJ, the Bergen Arts Museum in Paramus, NJ, the Paterson Museum in Paterson, NJ, the Dutot Museum in Delaware, Pa, and in various local galleries and art shows. Chiappini will be exhibiting recent works at the Nazareth Art Center in Nazareth, Pa in June of 2015. Chiappini is also the author and illustrator of five books: The Llama Who Wished For Wings, Claude’s Wings and Vincent’s Toes, a Tale of Two Friends, A Llama’s Tale, Freesia’s Little Llama Farm, and For Love of Claude, Adventures of a Llama Homesteader. She lives on a llama farm near the Delaware Water Gap in NJ.
