Marci has been teaching online Humanities, Art History, and Graphic Design classes for fifteen years. She studied Art History at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas, where she earned her B.A., cum laude in 1995. Marci studied abroad in Italy (Art of Tuscany) and at Cambridge University before moving to Los Angeles. There she worked as a production assistant in the Virtual Reality Studio at Walt Disney Imagineering and then later as a graphic designer at Walt Disney Studios.

While in graduate school, Marci had her two boys, Jake and Josh. She and her family moved from Los Angeles to Washington state in 2005.
